        <h1>Korea</h1>
        <p>South Korea is an amazing country to visit, whether for a cultural experience or just some fantastic tourist attractions.
            Korean culture is one of the world’s oldest and most fascinating cultures. From the fantastic food to the rich history, there’s so much to learn and experience.
             You can immerse yourself in ancient traditions, learn about the fascinating history, or try delicious and unique cuisines.
             And, of course, I would love to visit South Korea to check out some of my favourite K-Pop idols while I am there! 
             No trip to South Korea would be complete without experiencing some of their world-famous pop music. </p>
             <br>
        <p>South Korea is home to some truly incredible architecture, from the modern skyscrapers of Seoul to the traditional temples and palaces scattered across the country.
         The cityscapes are a sight to behold, and you can see South Korea’s progress in recent years. 
            The ancient buildings have been well preserved and offer a glimpse into the country’s rich history.</p>

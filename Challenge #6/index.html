            <p>A main dish is the primary dish of a meal, around which the meal is built. Usually it involves a protein such as meat or fish, or it can be something like a casserole with protein in it. It is often accompanied by one or more side dishes. In recent times, in my opinion, the main dish has often become the “only” dish at dinner. I do think this is part of the weight problem in our country. People are too busy to cook and if they get the protein part done, they are happy. This has led to the lack of side dishes of healthy vegetables. People tend to fill up on the protein and forget the vegetables. My website is heavy on Main Dish recipes because I find it’s easy to add a simple vegetable or salad to complete the meal. More often than not, people are searching, “What to fix for dinner.” Most of the main dishes on my website can be portioned out and frozen. The leftovers are often great for lunch.</p>

            <p>Dessert, the last course of a meal. In the United States dessert is likely to consist of pastry, cake, ice cream, pudding, or fresh or cooked fruit. British meals traditionally end with nuts, fruits, and port or other dessert wine, while French practice is to end with fruit, cheese, and wine; in both Britain and France, a more elaborate meal would include a sweet course preceding the dessert offerings. In Spain, Portugal, and Latin American countries, desserts of flan (a baked caramel custard) are ubiquitous. Other rich sweets based on eggs, milk, and fruits also are preferred. The elaborate cakes and tarts of central and northern Europe make the dessert course a glory of these cuisines. Indian cuisine offers sweet puddings and dense cakes flavoured with rosewater, honey, and nuts.</p>
            <p>In many cuisines, however, there is no usual sweet course; rather, fresh fruit, tea, or coffee constitute the end of the meal. In Japan and China, elaborate confections are usually eaten as snacks rather than as part of a meal.</p>
            <p>The dessert course reached its zenith in the banquets of the European courts of the 18th and 19th centuries, when the desire for ostentation and artifice coincided with the widespread availability of refined sugar and flour. On tables decorated with flowers and architectural fantasies in sugar and pastry were presented dozens of creams, tarts, fruits, cakes, pastries, puddings, jellies, and meringues.</p>

            <p>A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history.</p>
           <p>In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.</p>

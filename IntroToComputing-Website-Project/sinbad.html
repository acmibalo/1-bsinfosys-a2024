      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p><b>Sinbad</b>, born as a special First-Class Singularity in the Parthevia Empire, faces a childhood marked by 
        discrimination and loss. His father, <b>Badr</b>, is a war veteran who avoids fighting in the war with the Reim Empire, leading 
        to his forceful conscription and eventual death. Sinbad spends his youth caring for his ill mother, <b>Esra</b>, and helping the
         local villagers. His life changes when he meets a mysterious man named <b>Yunan</b>, who reveals himself as a Magi. Yunan, seeing 
         Sinbad’s potential and determination to change the world, instructs him to challenge the dungeon <b>"Baal,"</b> located at the border
          between Parthevia and Reim.</p>

        <p>Despite many failed attempts by warriors from both empires, Sinbad successfully conquers Baal,
           defeating a noble named Drakon in the process. He gains the allegiance of the Djinn within the dungeon, becoming 
           the <b>first Dungeon Capturer</b>. Sinbad then returns home, where he shares a final moment with his mother before her death,
            and decides to leave Parthevia to embark on his journey to change the world.</p>

            <p>Sinbad’s adventure continues as he sets sail and encounters Cerendine, a Parthevian general, 
              with whom he has a brief battle. He then travels to Imuchakk, where he meets <b>Hinahoho</b> and his sister. Together, 
              they defeat a sea monster, and Sinbad participates in the Imuchakk coming-of-age ceremony, where names are earned.
               However, Sinbad is unexpectedly attacked by Ja'far, an assassin from Parthevia’s Sham Lash, but he successfully defends 
               himself. Meanwhile, Hinahoho, feeling guilty for taking credit for Sinbad's victory over the sea monster, decides to
                capture the nearby dungeon, Valefor, as a form of self-redemption and to earn his name.</p>

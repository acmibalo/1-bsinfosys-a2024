      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Twenty-Fifth Bam</b>, has spent most of his life in the dark, confined space of a cave. 
        His only companion was a girl named <b>Rachel</b>, who one day decides to climb the Tower in order to see the stars.
         After Rachel disappears into the Tower, Bam follows her, desperate to find her and reunite. However, the Tower 
         is not just a physical structure—it's a dangerous and complex place, with each floor offering its own challenges, 
         traps, and powerful individuals.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The Tower is divided into many floors, and each floor is like a self-contained
         world with its own set of rules and rulers. To ascend, climbers must pass a series of tests to prove their worth. 
         On his journey, Bam meets various characters, including <b>Khun Aguero Agnis</b>, a skilled and strategic individual, and
        <b>Rak Wraithraiser</b>, a strong but eccentric creature. They form alliances and face a wide variety of enemies, each with
           their own motivations.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">As Bam climbs the Tower, he begins to uncover secrets about its true purpose, the mysterious forces
         controlling it, and his own origin. The deeper he goes, the more dangerous and complex the Tower becomes, as he discovers
          that many of the climbers have their own dark agendas. Throughout his journey, Bam must confront not only external challenges
           but also his own identity and the nature of his connection to the Tower.</p>

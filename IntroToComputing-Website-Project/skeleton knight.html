      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p>Upon awakening, an unnamed gamer finds himself in the body of his in-game avatar—a skeleton knight—due
         to the special skin he used. In a strange new world, he decides to keep his helmet on to hide his appearance and begins his 
         journey. He saves two women,<b> Lauren</b>, a noblewoman, and her maid <b>Rita</b>, from bandits and agrees to escort them to the town of 
         Luvierte. Along the way, he helps them navigate challenges and acquires a copper passport for easier travel.</p>

        <p> While traveling, he befriends a wounded fox, <b>Ponta</b>, and learns about the human trade in elves and their enslavement. 
        After rescuing two elf soldiers, <b>Ariane</b> and <b>Danka</b>, from slavers, he assists them in freeing other captured elves.
         During this time, Arc reveals his skeletal form to Ariane, who, although initially shocked, realizes he is under 
         a curse and promises to keep his secret.</p>
        
        <p> Arc continues his journey with Ariane and Ponta, helping elves and uncovering the extent of the slave trade.
         They are joined by Chiyome, a ninja from a beast people clan also fighting against human enslavement. Meanwhile,
         the political intrigue in the Rhoden Kingdom, involving power struggles between two ambitious royal brothers, is
          linked to the slave trade and the darker forces behind it.</p>
        
        <p>As Arc, Ariane, and Chiyome travel through different lands, they uncover the involvement of powerful nations, 
        including the Holy East Revlon Kingdom and the Holy Hilk Kingdom, in the widespread slavery and corruption, leading
         them to a larger battle against a hidden evil threatening the world.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Noor</b> was left an orphan at a young age with stories left by his Father telling him about ''Adventurers'', 
        the parts of them being awesome and cool, that stuck with Noor for a long time. Noor's primary reason for becoming an adventurer
        is to be of use to other people, and to help the weak who can not defend themselves. Noor spent 14 years furiously training his
        6 basic skills hoping to unlock a new flashier skill. However, while he could not learn new skills, Noor had failed to realize
        he's trained his 6 basic skills to superhuman levels that rival even the Six Sovereigns he failed to train under. Despite this,
        he takes a job as an F-rank Adventurer (which is functionally a day laborer/intern position), excited to be considered as an
        Adventurer.During one of these jobs, he encounters Lynne, who has been caught in a trap by her country's enemies,
         unable to use her magic and her Guards are quickly slaughtered by a summoned A-rank Minotaur creature. Noor steps in using a 
         fallen knight's sword and while he can't attack directly, his Parry skill is so powerful he ends up causing the beast to 
         injure itself until one lucky parry actually beheads the beast. Noor leaves before Lynne can thank him and wrongly thinks 
         he still has a long way to go after struggling "against a weird cow," not fully understanding the caliber of monster he just 
         defeated.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Krai Andrey</b>, a former soldier who, after years of brutal battles, is granted the chance to retire from
         his life as a warrior. Krai, however, is burdened with the trauma and grief of his violent past. He has served as the
          leader of a powerful adventurer party, but despite his status, Krai is physically weak compared to the other members of
           his party, who are all much stronger and more capable than him.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">After years of leading and fighting alongside his formidable comrades, 
        Krai’s longing for peace and a chance to live a quiet life begins to overshadow his previous desire for victory and glory.
         He’s tired of leading the strongest party and longs for retirement, away from constant warfare and battle.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">The story explores Krai's internal conflict as he navigates his position. Although Krai is weak in terms of combat ability,
         his strategic mind and leadership have kept his party together and led them to numerous victories. Despite his desire to
          step down, his skills as a leader are indispensable, and he struggles with his role as both a leader and a reluctant fighter.</p>

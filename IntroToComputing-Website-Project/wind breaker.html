      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">From an early age, <b>Haruka Sakura</b> was an outcast due to his unconventional appearance and lack of social skills.
         However, the harsh treatments he received made him a skilled fighter, which is now the only thing he prides himself on.
          After enrolling at <b>Furin High School</b>, where it is rumored that strength is valued over academics, Sakura has only one
           goal—to become the best..</p>
      <p class="w3-large">After being involved in a street brawl the day before his enrollment,
         Sakura meets a group of his future classmates. Instead of rejecting him, his classmates fight alongside him,
          showing that the school's real concern is protecting the town of Makochi from harm—hence why the students call 
          themselves <b>Bofurin</b>. Surprised by the support and appreciation of the townspeople, Sakura has a hard time accepting 
          their goodwill. Though he is unfamiliar with others showing him kindness, he must learn to overcome his discomfort 
          when Bofurin is pitted against formidable enemies. After experiencing the feeling of acceptance, he finds himself
           fighting for the sake of others for the first time.</p>

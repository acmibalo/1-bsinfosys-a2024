      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">A group of four Japanese citizens, consisting of three high school students and one adult, are magically 
        summoned to a parallel fantasy world by the Kingdom of Reijseger, who asks them for help in their war against the demon folk.
         As a result of the summoning ritual, the three students appear to have several powerful magical abilities and are accepted
          as "Heroes". However, the adult, an ordinary salaryman named<b>Tsuyoshi Mukouda</b> (<b>a.k.a. "Mukohda"</b>), is found to only have the
           power of <b>"Online Supermarket"</b>. Unwilling to become a hero and also harboring deep suspicion of the kingdom's true intentions,
            he convinces the nobles his ability is useless, allowing him to leave and pursue a simple life in the new world. 
            Experimenting with his Online Supermarket skill, he discovers he is able to instantly order food and other products
             from Japan. During his travels, he meets a legendary beast known as a <b>"Fenrir"</b>, who demands Mukohda feed him a meal.
              After numerous servings, the Fenrir, eventually named <b>Fel</b>, takes a liking to Mukohda's cooking and forces him to accept 
              a familiar contract. As Mukohda continues his journey, he encounters other monsters, as well as gods from the Divine Realm,
               who grant him familiar contracts and blessings in order to obtain his food and otherworldly goods. Soon, he realizes 
               that Fel is really overpowered, when he brings Mukohda an Earth Dragon.</p>

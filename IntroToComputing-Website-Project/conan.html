      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Detective Conan (also known as Case Closed) follows <b>Shinichi Kudo</b>, a brilliant high school detective who is
         known for solving complex cases. One day, while investigating a suspicious activity, Shinichi is poisoned by a mysterious
          organization known as the Black Organization. The poison causes him to shrink into the body of a child. To keep his new
           identity a secret and to continue his pursuit of the organization, Shinichi adopts the alias <b>"Conan Edogawa"</b> and moves in
            with his childhood friend, <b>Ran Mouri</b>, and her father, <b>Kogoro Mouri</b>, a bumbling private detective.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">While pretending to be a child, Conan continues to help solve cases with his sharp detective skills,
         often assisting Kogoro in his investigations, though Kogoro unknowingly takes the credit. As Conan tries to track down
          the <b>Black Organization</b> and find a way to return to his original form, he faces numerous challenges, uncovering more 
          mysteries, encountering new allies, and solving a variety of criminal cases.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Throughout the series, Conan works with his friends, including Ran, and other recurring characters,
             such as the <b>Detective Boys</b>, a group of kids he befriends. As he delves deeper into the organization and its members,
              the stakes continue to rise, and Conan gets closer to uncovering the truth behind the mysterious people who transformed
               him into a child. The story mixes crime-solving, action, suspense, and occasional moments of humor and romance.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Saitama</b>, an ordinary man who becomes the most powerful superhero in the world. Saitama, seeking excitement 
        in his life, trains so intensely that he becomes overwhelmingly strong. However, this strength comes with a twist: he 
        can defeat any opponent with a single punch, leaving him bored and frustrated with the lack of challenging battles.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Saitama joins the <b>Hero Association</b> to find worthy opponents and gain recognition,
         but despite his incredible power, he struggles with being unnoticed and underestimated by the public and other heroes. 
         He often ends up rescuing people or defeating villains with little effort, while the world remains unaware of his true 
         capabilities.</p>
         <p class="w3-large">Saitama's journey is filled with comedic moments, as he interacts with a colorful cast of characters,
             including <b>Genos</b>, a cyborg hero who becomes his disciple, and other eccentric heroes and villains. Despite his overwhelming
              power, Saitama longs for a true challenge and to be recognized for his efforts, creating a unique contrast between his
               god-like abilities and his down-to-earth personality.</p>

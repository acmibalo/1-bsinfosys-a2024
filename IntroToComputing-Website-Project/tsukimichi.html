      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">High school student <b>Makoto Misumi</b>, while being an average boy in every aspect, his sisters are well-spirited
         and good-looking. Underneath this, his parents are from a fantasy world and have eloped to Earth for various reasons. Partly
          due to a contract agreed upon by a goddess, Makoto is to be sent to the world of Elysion to serve as the Hero. Unfortunately,
           it is not the usual case that Makoto always imagined. The Goddess has a vain beauty preference and deems Makoto to be "ugly,"
            revoking his hero title, forbidding him to interact with other humans, and getting thrown off the edge of the world. 
            Makoto is thankfully saved by <b>Tsukuyomi</b>, and he is gifted with great power so he will live a free life. In contrast to
             the Goddess' ideals, Makoto meets various demi-humans and mythical beings who become captivated by him and join in on 
             building a new civilization where all of them can peacefully coexist. Another problem is Makoto's aura becomes too powerful
              and unstable for his yearning desire to enter human society. His new companions are willing to help him in any way to
               reform common sense along the way.</p>

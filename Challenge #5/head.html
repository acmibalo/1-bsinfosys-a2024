        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Ball in and Out of Play:</b>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Scoring:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>A goal is scored when the ball fully crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided no foul or offside has occurred.</li>
          <li>The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.</li>
          <li>If both teams have the same score, the match may end in a draw, go to extra time, or proceed to penalty shootouts, depending on the competition.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Fouls include tripping, pushing, handballs, and reckless challenges.</li>
          <li>A yellow card serves as a caution; two yellow cards equal a red card.</li>
          <li>A red card results in ejection from the match, leaving the team with one fewer player.</li>
          <li>Unsportsmanlike behavior, such as dissent or time-wasting, can result in disciplinary action.</li>

      </li>
      <li><b>Offside Rule:</b>

          <li><b>Goal Kick:</b> Awarded when the attacking team last touches the ball and it crosses the goal line without a goal being scored.</li>
          <li><b>Corner Kick:</b> Awarded when the defending team last touches the ball and it crosses the goal line without a goal being scored.</li>

          <li><b>Penalty Kick:</b> Awarded for fouls committed within the defending team’s penalty area.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>The Referee:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The referee enforces the rules and has the final say on all decisions.</li>
          <li>Video Assistant Referee (VAR) may assist in reviewing critical decisions such as goals, penalties, and red cards.</li>

          <li>Goalkeepers can use their hands within their penalty area but must release the ball within 6 seconds of gaining control.</li>
          <li>Advantage may be played if stopping play for a foul would disadvantage the non-offending team.</li>

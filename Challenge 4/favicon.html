    <h2>Types of Cats </h2>
    <h3>1. Abyssinian Cat</h3>
    <p>Usually outgoing and active, with a fondness for being the center of attention,<br>
         the Abyssinian cat develops a close bond with its family.<br>
          Even so, this breed has a shy side to its personality.<br>
         Abyssinian cats are often quick to disappear when strangers arrive.</p>
         <h3>2. Aegean Cat</h3>
        <p>Aegean cats are friendly and intelligent. <br>
            Over the millennia, they have developed a fondness for humans; <br>
            in Greece and the surrounding islands, they are valued for their rodent catching skills,<br> 
            and are often treated to bits of food by fishermen and other residents.<br>
             These cats make excellent family pets, as they like almost everyone.</p>
    <h3>3. American Curl Cat</h3>
    <p>American curl cats come in every color and pattern imaginable, in both long and shorthair varieties. <br>
        They have very little undercoat, and their topcoats tend to feel very soft and silky.</p>
    <h3>4. American Wirehair Cat</h3>
    <p>A soft heart and a sweet personality hide behind the rough exterior<br>
         of the American wirehair cat. These friendly felines are versatile and robust, <br>
        with a unique appearance that their families appreciate.</p>
        <h3>5. Cheetoh Cat</h3>
        <p>These incredible cats have a wild appearance, even though they are eight generations <br>
            removed from the wildcats that make up the breed's foundation. </p>
        <h3>6. Dragon Li Cat</h3>
        <p>Dragon Li cats appreciate the outdoors and are outstanding hunters. <br>
            They are at their happiest when allowed access to safely enclosed outdoor spaces such as catios,<br> 
            and when they are taught to walk on a leash from a young age.</p>

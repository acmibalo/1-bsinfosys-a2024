      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Mitsuyoshi Tada</b>, a boy who has never known love. He is taking pictures of the cherry blossoms in full 
        bloom when he meets <b>Teresa Wagner</b>, a transfer student from Larsenburg (ラルセンブルク, Rarusenburuku) which can be assumed
         means Luxembourg, a European country. She got separated from her travel companion upon arriving in Japan. Tada helps her
          and brings her to his grandfather's coffee shop. Teresa's travel companion and bodyguard Alec arrives and beats up Kaoru
           mistakenly thinking Kaoru was flirting with Teresa. They discover the hotel they're supposed to be staying at is actually
            next to Tada's cafe. The next day, they enroll in Tada's school and are in the same class. Alec agrees on joining the
             Photography Club on Teresa's request she wants to learn to take great pictures. Mitsuyoshi is actually an aspiring 
             photographer and wants to follow his father's footsteps to be a famous photographer. Mitsuyoshi lost his parents in
              a car accident during his childhood. The one last photo his father took and his camera were the only things he has 
              left from his parents. The story focuses on the adventures of Tada and his friends and their building relationships.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">The <b>Four Cardinal Heroes</b> are a group of ordinary men from modern-day Japn summoned to the
         <b></b>Kingdom of Melromarc</b> to become its saviors. Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly
         ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed
         a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. <b class="w3-cursive">Naofumi Iwatani</b>, an otaku, becomes
         cursed with the fate of being the <b>"Shield Hero"</b>. Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and
          ridiculed by his fellow heroes and kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">When the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi
        sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, <b class="w3-cursive">Malty Melromarc</b>. He is soon
        betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then bcomes heavily
        discrimanated against and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust
        in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being 
        on hus own sets in, so Naofumi bus a demi-human slave on the verge of death named <b>Raphtalia</b> to accompany him on his travels.

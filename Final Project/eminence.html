      <h5 class="w3-center">Summary</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"><b>Cid Kagenou</b>, a young boy who is fascinated by the idea of being a powerful, secretive figure working in
         the shadows. In his past life, Cid was an ordinary person who was obsessed with the concept of "being in the shadows," 
         secretly controlling events from behind the scenes. After his death in a car accident, he is reincarnated in a fantasy 
         world where he continues to pursue his dream of being a shadowy mastermind, even though he is reborn into a new body with
          magical abilities.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Cid strives to act like an inconspicuous figure, but he secretly builds a fake organization called
    <b>Shadow Garden</b>, which he believes will fight against an evil cult. He creates elaborate stories about an underground 
         cult called <b>Diabolos</b> that he and his organization are fighting, all of it being entirely fabricated. However, unbeknownst
          to Cid, his organization and the supposed evil cult he made up are actually real, and his actions begin to have unintended 
          consequences as he inadvertently becomes a true <b>"eminence in shadow."</b></p>

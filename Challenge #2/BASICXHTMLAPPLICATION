    <h2>THE KING NEVER DIES</h2>
    <p>Alexander (June 1, 1999 – June 2022), known online as Technoblade (/ˈtɛk.noʊˌbleɪd/ TEK-noh-blayd), was an American YouTuber known 
        for his Minecraft videos, livestreams, and involvement in the Dream SMP. Technoblade registered his main channel on YouTube in 2013.

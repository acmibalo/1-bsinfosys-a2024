 <p>I'm a work in progress, constantly learning and growing. My life has had its ups and downs, shaping my empathy and passion for connecting with others. I love helping people navigate life's complexities, offering support and understanding.  My interests are varied, including psychology and the creative arts.  This isn't just an introduction; it's an invitation to connect and explore our shared human experience together. Join me as we explore, learn, and grow together. Just message me and we will talk endlessly.</p>

     <p> So, who am I?  That's a question I've been wrestling with since, well, forever.  I'm not one of those people who has a perfectly crafted, concise answer.  My life's more of a chaotic, beautiful mess than a neatly organized spreadsheet.  </p>

<p>Hi, my name is Alyssa Lacorte Serfino, 18 years old and a first year college student at the University of Southern Mindanao–Main Campus located at Kabacan North Cotabato. I am currently taking the course Bachelor of Science in Information System. I am born on 22nd of August year 2006 here in my hometown, at Poblacion Carmen North Cotabato.</p>
 
<p>I grew up in Poblacion Carmen, an average town where everyone knew everyone.  Those early years shaped me in ways I'm still figuring out – instilled a love for reading and writing. I was a dreamer.</p>
 
<p>School was… a mixed bag.  I excelled at English but struggled mightily with Math.  I learned more outside the classroom than in, honestly.  I discovered my love for dancing and singing (though does not have a singer's voice but still) during those years, and that's something I still cherish.</p>
 
<p>Now?  I'm navigating the messy yet wonderful world of college life. I chose the course of Information Systems because i am willing to learn and apply it in my career, because we are already living in IT era—  where everything is high tech and advanced. I thought of that advancement as an opportunity, for a bigger and better career, knowledge and wisdom. It's challenging, exhilarating, and often completely overwhelming.  There are days when I feel like I'm totally nailing it, and days when I just want to curl up with a blanket, a cup of coffee (lots of coffee), and a good music.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about my course, yes it is quite a tough and hard one but i am thriving. I value relationships, friendships, and looking forward in socializing and meeting other new people. I'm still learning, still growing, still making a whole lot of mistakes along the way.  And that's okay.  Because that's what makes life interesting, right?</p>
 
<p>So, that's me in a nutshell – or maybe more like a slightly cracked, overflowing teacup.  A little messy, a little quirky, and always learning.  I aim to provide helpful advice and insights that can empower you. </p>

<!-- Here are five features from the W3Schools "How To" examples utilized in this code:

1. Responsive Navbar with Toggle Menu
   - The navbar is hidden on medium and large screens and toggled on small screens using the `toggleFunction()`. This is achieved by using the `w3-bar-item w3-button` classes in combination with JavaScript for handling the menu display when the hamburger icon (`fa-bars`) is clicked.

2. Parallax Scrolling Effect
   - The `bgimg-1`, `bgimg-2`, and `bgimg-3` classes create a parallax effect on the background images by using `background-attachment: fixed`. This keeps the background fixed while the rest of the page content scrolls.

3. Image Gallery with Modal
   - The images in the "Portfolio" section open in a modal when clicked. The `onClick` function changes the source of the modal image and displays it with a caption. The modal itself is designed with `w3-modal` and `w3-image` classes.

4. Social Media Icons and Links 
   - Social media links are displayed using Font Awesome icons (`fa-facebook`, `fa-instagram`, etc.) inside the footer and other sections. These icons are styled with `w3-hover-opacity` to provide hover effects.

5. Responsive Layout with W3.CSS 
   - The layout uses W3.CSS for a responsive grid system, particularly for the "Pictures" section. The images are arranged in four columns on larger screens using `w3-col m3` and stack on smaller screens due to the responsiveness built into W3.CSS.
